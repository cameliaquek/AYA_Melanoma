# Immunosuppresive spatiotypes in young melanoma immunotherapy patients
Main contributor: Catherine (Xinyu) Bai
Codes used to perform analysis in manuscript entitled "Baseline immunosuppresive spatiotypes in adolescent and young adult melanoma patients treated with checkpoint immunotherapy". The RNAseq files are provided in the methods section of the manuscript. The analysis focus on filtering low gene counts from fixed tissues retrieved from young melanoma patients, identifying differentially expressed genes, gene set enrichment and YIM scoring.
