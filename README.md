# Immunosuppresive spatiotypes in young melanoma immunotherapy patients
Codes used to perform analysis in the manuscript entitled "Stroma-infiltrating T cell spatiotypes defines immunotherapy outcomes in adolescent and young adult patients with melanoma". The RNAseq files are provided in the methods section of the manuscript. The analysis focuses on filtering low gene counts from fixed tissues retrieved from young melanoma patients, identifying differentially expressed genes, gene set enrichment, and YIM (young immunosuppressive melanoma) scoring.
